# Hello there!

I started learning MERN stack recently and found that on my way there, Redux is a very useful tool to help different components to interact with each other.
Redux is also useful for managing states among different components!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
To execute the project! You will be able to:
- Fetch the contents on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Add your own Post and you will see the result reflected on the page!

I haven't settup the backend database for this project, but I am making a MERN application which everything will be implemented there!
So please bear with me and check it out!
Thank you for your support!
